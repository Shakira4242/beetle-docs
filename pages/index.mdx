## Philosophy

> *“Alright, check this out. You know how chatbots are, right? They're supposed to be simple, smart, and user-friendly. But why are we locking them up in a tiny chat window? That's like putting Prince in a karaoke bar and telling him he can only sing 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.' It just ain't right.”*  
> — Dave Chappelle

## Designed for no-coders who want to build chatbots
